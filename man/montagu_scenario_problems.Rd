\description{
A scenario describes the vaccination conditions for a particular run of a
model. Typical examples include a scenario where there is no vaccination,
a scenario where there is routine (background) vaccination, or a scenario
in which there are targetted campaigns to vaccinate particularly ages.
Depending on disease, modelling groups may be asked to model various
scenarios, for a particular touchstone.
