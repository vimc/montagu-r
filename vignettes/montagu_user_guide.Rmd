In this vignette, we describe a typical example of building
a model in R, which uses the demography and templates available
through the Montagu API, and submited burden estimates to it. We
will proceed very naively and cover all of the important
functionality on the way.

### Identify the Montagu Server

Begin by identifying the Montagu server to connect to. You must
have an account on this server; typically this will be our live
production server, and you will have received login information
on joining VIMC. Identify the server as follows:-

```r
montagu::montagu_server_global_default_set(
  montagu::montagu_server("production", "montagu.vaccineimpact.org"))
```



The next time you query the server, you may be asked to
login with a username and password.

### Basic Information

For many of the montagu api functions, you will need to provide your
modelling group id, and your disease id. These will have been communicated on
joining VIMC, but can be looked up with simple function calls like this:-


```r
montagu::montagu_diseases()
```

```
##         id                         name
## 1     HepB                         HepB
## 2      Hib                          Hib
## 3      HPV                          HPV
## 4       JE                           JE
## 5  Measles                      Measles
## 6     MenA                         MenA
## 7      PCV                          PCV
## 8     Rota                    Rotavirus
## 9  Rubella                      Rubella
## 10      YF                 Yellow fever
## 11     DTP Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis
```

TO-DO - i2557

```r
montagu::montagu_modelling_groups()
```

### Touchstones

A touchstone is an identifier that links:

* A request from VIMC to the modelling groups to provide burden estimates
* The input data (coverage and demography) provided to calculate those estimates
* The estimates submitted by the groups using the input data.

Touchstone ids are referred to as a basename and a version together. Errata
to the input data may be addressed with a new touchstone version. Generally,
modelling groups will know which touchstone they are required to run models
against. To lookup all the currently open touchstones for a group:-


```r
montagu::montagu_touchstone_versions("IC-Garske", require_open = TRUE)
```

```
##                  id            name version                 description
## 6      201710gavi-5      201710gavi       5      201710gavi (version 5)
## 7 201810synthetic-2 201810synthetic       2 201810synthetic (version 2)
##   status
## 6   open
## 7   open
```

If we knew the basic touchstone name (without version) that we were interested in,
then we could also have asked:

```r
montagu::montagu_touchstone_versions("IC-Garske", "201710gavi", require_open = TRUE)
```

```
##             id       name version            description status
## 1 201710gavi-5 201710gavi       5 201710gavi (version 5)   open
```

### Scenarios

Within a touchstone, we may have various scenarios, describing different
vaccination conditions. These vary across diseases due to the different types
of vaccination approaches that have been employed. We look our the scenarios
we are required to model for a touchstone with:


```r
montagu::montagu_scenarios("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
##          scenario_id                  description disease
## 1  yf-no-vaccination               No vaccination      YF
## 2    yf-routine-gavi               Routine, total      YF
## 3 yf-preventive-gavi Campaign (preventive), total      YF
```

We can then look up the status a particular scenario within this touchstone:


```r
montagu::montagu_scenario_status("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
```

```
## [1] "valid"
```

and if that status were not valid, then we can query any problems with:

```r
montagu::montagu_scenario_problems("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
```

```
## list()
```

### Expectations - years, ages, countries and outcomes

For a given touchstone, modelling groups are required to produce burden estimates
stratified by calendar year, and by age. The expectations about time and age
will be consistent across scenarios. We can look up these expectations like so:


```r
montagu::montagu_expectations("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
##   id           description min_year max_year min_age max_age
## 1 30 YF:IC-Garske:standard     2000     2100       0     100
##   min_birth_cohort max_birth_cohort disease
## 1             1900             2100      YF
```

Some modelling groups model more than one disease, in which case a row appears
for each disease. And additionally, if there is some reason to have different
expectations for different scenarios, then multiple lines for the same disease
may appear, with a difference in the description column indicating the scenario.
For example:

```r
montagu::montagu_expectations("CDA-Razavi", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
##   id                                            description min_year
## 1  2                   HepB:CDA-Razavi:hepb-bd-routine-with     2000
## 2  4 HepB:CDA-Razavi:hepb-bd-routine-with-hepb-routine-with     2000
## 3  3                 HepB:CDA-Razavi:hepb-hepb-routine-with     2000
## 4  1                    HepB:CDA-Razavi:hepb-no-vaccination     2000
## 5  5 HepB:CDA-Razavi:hepb-bd-routine-best-hepb-routine-with     2000
##   max_year min_age max_age min_birth_cohort max_birth_cohort disease
## 1     2100       0      85             1915             2100    HepB
## 2     2100       0      85             1915             2100    HepB
## 3     2100       0      85             1915             2100    HepB
## 4     2100       0      85             1915             2100    HepB
## 5     2100       0      85             1915             2100    HepB
```

If we already knew the expectation id, we could look up
a single expectation with


```r
montagu::montagu_expectation("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## $id
## [1] 30
##
## $description
## [1] "YF:IC-Garske:standard"
##
## $min_year
## [1] 2000
##
## $max_year
## [1] 2100
##
## $min_age
## [1] 0
##
## $max_age
## [1] 100
##
## $min_birth_cohort
## [1] 1900
##
## $max_birth_cohort
## [1] 2100
##
## $disease
## NULL
```

The countries for which estimates are required can vary between disease, and
between scenarios. To retrieve the list of countries that are required for a
particular expectation:-


```r
countries <- montagu::montagu_expectation_countries("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
head(countries)
```

```
##    id                     name
## 1 AGO                   Angola
## 2 BDI                  Burundi
## 3 BEN                    Benin
## 4 BFA             Burkina Faso
## 5 CAF Central African Republic
## 6 CIV            Cote d'Ivoire
```

To see which outcomes are required for an expectation:

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_outcomes("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## [1] "deaths" "cases"  "dalys"
```

And to confirm which scnearios an expectation applies to (which should align
with the description text for the expectation):

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## [1] "yf-no-vaccination"  "yf-preventive-gavi" "yf-routine-gavi"
```

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios("CDA-Razavi", "201710gavi-5", 2)
```

```
## [1] "hepb-bd-routine-with"
```

### Templates

The above will give all the information required to build your own data frame
for submitting the expected results. Alternatively, you can download
burden estimate templates with the years, countries and ages already populated:-


```r
df <- montagu::montagu_central_burden_estimate_template("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
head(df)
```

```
##   disease year age country country_name cohort_size deaths cases dalys
## 1      YF 2000   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
## 2      YF 2001   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
## 3      YF 2002   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
## 4      YF 2003   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
## 5      YF 2004   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
## 6      YF 2005   0     AGO       Angola          NA     NA    NA    NA
```

### Coverage

We now need to obtain the coverage data relevant for our disease and touchstone,
for each of the scenarios we're going to model. Let's look at the `yf-routine-gavi`
coverage metadata.


```r
montagu::montagu_coverage_info("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
```

```
##    id touchstone_version                  name vaccine gavi_support
## 1 651       201710gavi-5 YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
##   activity_type
## 1       routine
```

And now let's retrieve the coverage data itself, and summarise it.


```r
cov <- montagu::montagu_coverage_data("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
head(cov[cov$coverage > 0, ])
```

```
##           scenario              set_name vaccine gavi_support
## 18 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
## 19 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
## 20 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
## 21 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
## 22 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
## 23 yf-routine-gavi YF: YF, with, routine      YF        total
##    activity_type country_code country year age_first age_last
## 18       routine          AGO  Angola 1997         0        0
## 19       routine          AGO  Angola 1998         0        0
## 20       routine          AGO  Angola 1999         0        0
## 21       routine          AGO  Angola 2000         0        0
## 22       routine          AGO  Angola 2001         0        0
## 23       routine          AGO  Angola 2002         0        0
##    age_range_verbatim target coverage
## 18               <NA>   <NA>     0.37
## 19               <NA>   <NA>     0.45
## 20               <NA>   <NA>     0.53
## 21               <NA>   <NA>     0.50
## 22               <NA>   <NA>     0.46
## 23               <NA>   <NA>     0.46
```

```r
range(cov$year)
```

```
## [1] 1980 2100
```

```r
length(unique(cov$country_code))
```

```
## [1] 32
```

```r
nrow(cov)
```

```
## [1] 3872
```

```r
ncol(cov)
```

```
## [1] 13
```
More information on the coverage is available in the Montagu Web Portal, but briefly:

* _Coverage_ is measured as a proportion of the original target population. It is possible
for this to exceed 1, if more people were vaccinated than originally targeted.
* _Target_ is the number of individuals targeted for vaccination. If this is `NA`, then
assume the target population matches the demographic data, and the whole population is targeted.

#### Long or Wide format

The data above is formatted in what we call `long format`, in which one year is reported per row.
Alternatively, you can specify:

```r
cov <- montagu::montagu_coverage_data("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi", format="wide")
names(cov)[1:20]
```

```
##  [1] "scenario"           "set_name"           "vaccine"
##  [4] "gavi_support"       "activity_type"      "country_code"
##  [7] "country"            "age_first"          "age_last"
## [10] "age_range_verbatim" "coverage_1980"      "coverage_1981"
## [13] "coverage_1982"      "coverage_1983"      "coverage_1984"
## [16] "coverage_1985"      "coverage_1986"      "coverage_1987"
## [19] "coverage_1988"      "coverage_1989"
```

```r
nrow(cov)
```

```
## [1] 32
```

```r
ncol(cov)
```

```
## [1] 252
```
Here, we have one row per country, and separate columns for `coverage_year` and `target_year`.

#### Returning the full range of countries

By default, the coverage data returned is limited to those countries for which burden
estimate data is required for the given scenario. HepB is a particular example, where different
sets of countries are relevant in different scenarios, because the birth-dose vaccination
is not applied in all countries where there is HepB vaccination. However, some groups prefer
to model all of these scenarios similarly, with the same numbers of countries, hence they require
the full coverage data for all countries. For those cases, the following optional argument can be used:


```r
cov <- montagu::montagu_coverage_data("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi", all_countries=TRUE)
```

It was then compared to the available serological data, primarily from central and eastern Africa, to assess the country-specific scale of under-reporting and obtain absolute estimates of transmission intensity in terms of a static force of infection or a basic reproduction number in a dynamical model, taking into account the population-level vaccination coverage through time. Burden and vaccine impact estimates were then generated by combining the transmission intensity with demographic information (population size and age distribution) and observed and hypothetical vaccination coverages in any given location and year."

Note that the model_id is different from the modelling_group_id, and in most
circumstance, the modelling_group_id is the significant identifier required
for other Montagu functions.
