In this vignette, we describe a typical example of building
a model in R, which uses the demography and templates available
through the Montagu API, and submited burden estimates to it. We
will proceed very naively and cover all of the important
functionality on the way.

### Identify the Montagu Server

Begin by identifying the Montagu server to connect to. You must
have an account on this server; typically this will be our live
production server, and you will have received login information
on joining VIMC. Identify the server as follows:-

```r
montagu::montagu_server_global_default_set(
  montagu::montagu_server("production", "montagu.vaccineimpact.org"))
```



The next time you query the server, you may be asked to
login with a username and password.

### Basic Information

For many of the montagu api functions, you will need to provide your
modelling group id, and your disease id. These will have been communicated on
joining VIMC, but can be looked up with simple function calls like this:-


```r
montagu::montagu_diseases()
```

```
##         id                         name
## 1     HepB                         HepB
## 2      Hib                          Hib
## 3      HPV                          HPV
## 4       JE                           JE
## 5  Measles                      Measles
## 6     MenA                         MenA
## 7      PCV                          PCV
## 8     Rota                    Rotavirus
## 9  Rubella                      Rubella
## 10      YF                 Yellow fever
## 11     DTP Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis
