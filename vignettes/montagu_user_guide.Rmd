In this vignette, we describe a typical example of building
a model in R, which uses the demography and templates available
through the Montagu API, and submited burden estimates to it. We
will proceed very naively and cover all of the important
functionality on the way.

### Identify the Montagu Server

Begin by identifying the Montagu server to connect to. You must
have an account on this server; typically this will be our live
production server, and you will have received login information
on joining VIMC. Identify the server as follows:-

```r
montagu::montagu_server_global_default_set(
  montagu::montagu_server("production", "montagu.vaccineimpact.org"))
```



The next time you query the server, you may be asked to
login with a username and password.

### Basic Information

For many of the montagu api functions, you will need to provide your
modelling group id, and your disease id. These will have been communicated on
joining VIMC, but can be looked up with simple function calls like this:-


```r
montagu::montagu_diseases()
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_diseases' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

TO-DO - i2557

```r
montagu::montagu_modelling_groups()
```

### Touchstones

A touchstone is an identifier that links:

* A request from VIMC to the modelling groups to provide burden estimates
* The input data (coverage and demography) provided to calculate those estimates
* The estimates submitted by the groups using the input data.

Touchstone ids are referred to as a basename and a version together. Errata
to the input data may be addressed with a new touchstone version. Generally,
modelling groups will know which touchstone they are required to run models
against. To lookup all the currently open touchstones for a group:-


```r
montagu::montagu_touchstone_versions("IC-Garske", require_open = TRUE)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_touchstone_versions' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

If we knew the basic touchstone name (without version) that we were interested in,
then we could also have asked:

```r
montagu::montagu_touchstone_versions("IC-Garske", "201710gavi", require_open = TRUE)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_touchstone_versions' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

### Scenarios

Within a touchstone, we may have various scenarios, describing different
vaccination conditions. These vary across diseases due to the different types
of vaccination approaches that have been employed. We look our the scenarios
we are required to model for a touchstone with:


```r
montagu::montagu_scenarios("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_scenarios' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

We can then look up the status a particular scenario within this touchstone:


```r
montagu::montagu_scenario_status("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_scenario_status' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

and if that status were not valid, then we can query any problems with:

```r
montagu::montagu_scenario_problems("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", "yf-routine-gavi")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_scenario_problems' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

### Expectations - years, ages, countries and outcomes

For a given touchstone, modelling groups are required to produce burden estimates
stratified by calendar year, and by age. The expectations about time and age
will be consistent across scenarios. We can look up these expectations like so:


```r
montagu::montagu_expectations("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectations' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

Some modelling groups model more than one disease, in which case a row appears
for each disease. And additionally, if there is some reason to have different
expectations for different scenarios, then multiple lines for the same disease
may appear, with a difference in the description column indicating the scenario.
For example:

```r
montagu::montagu_expectations("CDA-Razavi", "201710gavi-5")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectations' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

If we already knew the expectation id, we could look up
a single expectation with


```r
montagu::montagu_expectation("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectation' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

The countries for which estimates are required can vary between disease, and
between scenarios. To retrieve the list of countries that are required for a
particular expectation:-


```r
countries <- montagu::montagu_expectation_countries("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectation_countries' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

```r
head(countries)
```

```
## Error in head(countries): object 'countries' not found
```

To see which outcomes are required for an expectation:

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_outcomes("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectation_outcomes' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

And to confirm which scnearios an expectation applies to (which should align
with the description text for the expectation):

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

```r
montagu::montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios("CDA-Razavi", "201710gavi-5", 2)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_expectation_applicable_scenarios' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

### Templates

The above will give all the information required to build your own data frame
for submitting the expected results. Alternatively, you can download
burden estimate templates with the years, countries and ages already populated:-


```r
df <- montagu::montagu_central_burden_estimate_template("IC-Garske", "201710gavi-5", 30)
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_central_burden_estimate_template' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

```r
head(df)
```

```
##
## 1 function (x, df1, df2, ncp, log = FALSE)
## 2 {
## 3     if (missing(ncp))
## 4         .Call(C_df, x, df1, df2, log)
## 5     else .Call(C_dnf, x, df1, df2, ncp, log)
## 6 }
```

## Appendix

### Models

Montagu allows querying of basic information about all models, past and present
used in VIMC. These can be listed as follows:-


```r
models <- montagu::montagu_models()
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_models' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

```r
head(models)
```

```
## Error in head(models): object 'models' not found
```

and a list of information about a particular model by its id can be retrieved
like this:-


```r
models <- montagu::montagu_model("YFIC")
```

```
## Error: 'montagu_model' is not an exported object from 'namespace:montagu'
```

```r
head(models)
```

```
## Error in head(models): object 'models' not found
```

Note that the model_id is different from the modelling_group_id, and in most
circumstance, the modelling_group_id is the significant identifier required
for other Montagu functions.
